######individual product choice######

cough_e: >-
  If you have a cough, the problem is typically that mucus **stucks in your Lungs**. For the cough to stop permanently, the mucus **has to come out.** 
  And it comes out through coughing - otherwise it can become inflamed. 
#That's why I recommend using cough expectorants and only if necessary a cough suppressant. 

#4products: "I want to show you the best medications against cough:"
warning: For risks and side effects read the package leaflet and ask your practitioner or pharmacist.

#individual: What do you think?
#individual_ag: What is the right one for me?
#individual_ad: I want to buy it.

mobility: Do you want "mobile" medication so that you can continue to go about your everyday life in the best possible way? Or are you at home right now anyway?
mobility_true: Medications for the road, please! 
mobility_false: I'm just taking the time to take special care of myself. 

choice_tablet: The tablets work almost as well as the syrup, but are much easier to take on the road.
choice_tablet_ok: Sounds good.
choice_tablet_change_to_sirup: Even on the road I prefer to have a syrup. As long as it has the strongest effect!

choice_sirup: When you're home anyway, I recommend you to take cough syrup, because it has the strongest effect.
choice_sirup_ok: Sounds good.
choice_sirup_change_to_tablet: I don't like syrups, I'd rather take pills. Even if they're not as strong as the syrup.

#what_next: Now, you can just buy them. You can answer the questions below so that I can select one for you. What say you?
#what_next_ag: Sure, let's go!
#what_next_ad: Just wanna buy
#what_next_do: Ok, just click *Add to Basket* on any medication above to add them to the cart

calmer_q: Do you cough especially at night and does the cough keep you from sleeping ? Or is it more like coughing in the morning? 
calmer_yes: The cough keeps me from sleeping.
calmer_no: My sleep is not disturbed by my cough.

choice_calmer: Your sleep is important so that your body can recover and you get healthy again! I also recommend to take a cough suppressant before sleeping, so that you can sleep more calmly.
choice_calmer_ok: Sounds good.
only_one_product: I only want to buy one product. Then which one is the right one? 
only_calmer: I just want to buy the cough suppressant!

calmer_vs_expect: Since a cough suppressant only inhibits the cough reflex I don't think you should use it consistently. I consider it merely as an aid to ensure the important and restful sleep. The rest of the day it is important to clear your airways of mucus, so if you only want to buy one product, I advise you to use an expectorant. 
still_calmer: I still only want to buy the cough suppressant.
understood_expect: Okay, thanks for the tip, then I'll buy only the expectorant.

one_last_thing: "Two last tips before we talk about your safety:"
one_last_thing_tips: >- 
  * Try to drink plenty of fluids: 3-4 liters per day. A well hydrated body has it easy to cough up mucus.

  * To support your body even further your could use a cream like that.

all_right: All right?
